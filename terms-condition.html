        <h1>Seats, Meals, Frequent Flyer and Other Special Requests</h1>
        <p>
          The seats, meals, frequent flyer and any other special request raised
          by a customer is treated as request only. If a customer cancels the
          booking, our service fee of up to $10 as well as paid seat charges
          which is levied to place such special request on your behalf stands
          non-refundable. It must also be known to our customers that we do not
          undertake any responsibility in ensuring that the seat(s) selected
          will be assigned to them and/or the meal(s), frequent flyer and other
          special requests shall be honored by the airline. Thus, customers are
          recommended that they contact the airline directly to get a status
          update on these requests prior to the scheduled departure date.

        <h1>Baggage Policy and Fees</h1>
        <p>
          On many airlines, the first checked-in bag is now subject to a fee,
          therefore customers are recommended to travel light to avoid paying
          higher baggage fee. To gain insight into the baggage fee for the
          different airlines, view our Baggage Fees page. It must also be known
          that traveling with excess baggage is subject to an excess baggage fee
          that varies across airlines. The baggage policy for every airline is
          different and the baggage fee could range anywhere between $15 to $200
          depending on a number of factors such as size, weight and number of
          bags. However, if the booking stands cancelled, our service fee of up
          to $12 and Baggage fee for few of the airlines is subject to a no
          refund. At all times, we ensure that the details on baggage fee
          viewable to our customers are updated but we strongly recommend that
          customers reach out to the airlines directly to find out about their
          latest baggage policy.

        <h1>Hotels Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <h1>Occupancy</h1>
        <p>
          There are some hotels which do not allow additional guests. So,
          availability of accommodation for more than two adults cannot always
          be guaranteed. In case the hotel chosen by you allows additional
          guests, some additional charges may be applicable for the same. The
          charges to be paid might be different depending on the hotel you
          choose and would be payable directly to the hotel, not to the Company
          (Travelogenie).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Check-in</h1>
        <p>
          While checking-in to a hotel, the person in whose name the reservation
          is made is required to present a valid ID at the check-in desk and
          deposit an amount. The payment for this amount can be made by
          credit/debit card or cash. The amount that is to be deposited is
          usually determined by the hotel. Hence, the amount that is to be
          deposited at the time of checking-in to a hotel would differ from
          hotel to hotel. Please note that at some hotels, debit cards may not
          be accepted. The deposit made by a hotel guest at the time of
          checking-in to a hotel is not related to any payment that is received
          by the Company (Infinity Travel Mate).
        </p>

      <section>
        <h1>Changes to the Hotel Reservation and Cancelations</h1>
        <p>
          Each hotel has their own cancelation policy. There might be some hotel
          reservations that are non-cancellable and no-alterable. Some hotel
          reservations may be cancellable but a cancelation fee might be levied
          for the same. There are also those hotels where a reservation can be
          cancelled, with a full refund. Then there are those hotels where the
          cancelation of or changes to the prepaid hotel reservation is allowed,
          but such changes or cancelation might be permitted only if a new
          reservation is made with that same hotel. You, hereby, acknowledge and
          accept that in no instance would the Company (Infinity Travel Mate)
          need to refund any amount.

      <section>
        <h1>Late Arrival and Failure to Check-in on First Night</h1>
        <p>
          In case a person gets delayed and is unable to check-in to the hotel
          on the date when she or he was supposed to check-in, that person needs
          to contact the hotel directly and inform them about the change in
          their travel plans. If a person does not check-in to the hotel as
          scheduled and does not inform the hotel about the change in his/her
          travel plans either, then the hotel reserves the right to cancel the
          remaining portion of the reservation and may also choose not to give a
          refund to the person. The decision taken by the hotel depends entirely
          on a particular hotel terms and conditions.

          needs (for example: if you need to travel with a service animal), then
          it is advisable that you contact the hotel to verify that during your
          stay there, your specific needs can be met by the hotel.

          of hotel room, bed or other such requests (smoking, non-smoking) made
          by you while making a hotel reservation. It depends largely on the
          availability of the particular hotel room and bed type, and at the
          sole discretion of the hotel. If you have any specific requests, then
          you would need to contact the hotel and verify if your specific
          requests can be met by the hotel. You, hereby, acknowledge the fact
          that the Company (Infinity Travel Mate) has no control when it comes
          to such requests and is not able to assist you in this regard.

          and other information related to the hotels displayed on our website
          are received from the hotels. In case a hotel is listed at an

          error, we (Travelogenie) reserve the right to cancel any hotel
          reservation that was booked under those prices or information. To that
          end and notwithstanding anything to the contrary of the things
          mentioned herein, we (Travelogenie) hold the right to cancel hotel
          reservations, regardless of the fact whether or not your hotel
          reservation request has already been confirmed; or whether your credit
          or debit card has already been charged. If you’ve already been charged
          for the reservation and your request is then cancelled because of this
          reason, you would get a refund in the amount of the charge.

          Company (Travelogenie) while making a hotel reservation includes the

        <h1>Rental Cars Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p>
          The rental cars that are booked through this website are subject to
          your chosen rental car company's rental contract. When you go to pick
          up the rental car, you would be asked to agree to the contract
          provided by them. If you want to read the terms and conditions, of
          such a rental contract, then it is advisable, that you contact your
          chosen travel service provider (car rental provider) directly. We,
          Travelogenie, have no say to the terms of the rental contract drawn by
          the car rental company. We try our best to maintain accuracy while
          displaying the prices and the relevant information pertaining to
          rental cars. Rental cars information and prices are provided to us by
          the rental car companies. If, in any case, a rental car information or
          price shown on the website is different from the actual information or
          price of the rental car, and its cause is the incorrect price and/or
          incorrect information given to us by the rental car company, then we
          undisputedly reserve the right to cancel any rental car booking that
          was made under that price and/or information. To that end, and
          notwithstanding anything to the contrary of the condition given here,
          we hold the right to cancel any such booking request, regardless of
          what your booking request status is (confirmed or not), and whether
          your credit card has been charged yet or not. In case your credit card
          gets charged and the booking gets cancelled due to the reason
          mentioned above, you would be provided with a refund for the amount
          that was charged to your credit card. When you make a rental car
          booking, at the displayed price, please be advised that our company,
          Infinity Travel Mate, won't change your credit card for the amount
          that is to be paid for the rental car. Instead, your credit card
          information would be useful while making the rental car booking. Also,
          we would provide you with an estimated amount which you would need to
          pay to the rental car company when you go to pick up the vehicle. The
          amount that is to be paid to the car rental company by you, may be a
          bit different from the amount that is estimated by us, depending on
          factors such as additional items that you may choose to add to your
          rental car reservation at the time of picking up the car and a change
          in schedule, if you need to pick up the rental car earlier than you
          said you would or would need to drop off the rental car later than you
          had expected to. While picking up the rental car, the person who is
          scheduled to drive the vehicle would be required to present a valid
          driver's license and a valid credit card that is in the driver's name.
          Herein, you should know that a rental car's particular make and model
          are subject to availability. And so, the vehicle you choose at the
          time of making the rental car booking can be different from the car
          you get at the time of picking up the vehicle. Our company,
          Travelogenie, is not the vendor who is responsible for collecting and
          remitting taxes to the specific taxing authorities. The rental car
          suppliers are the ones who bill all the applicable taxes to the
          company (Travelogenie) and the company makes the required payment
          directly to the rental car suppliers. The company (Travelogenie) is
          not a co-vendor (of the car rentals) associated with the rental car
          suppliers through which we make the rental car reservations for our
          customers. The type of taxes that are applicable on a rental car
          booking, and the amount that is chargeable as tax might differ
          depending on the location where the rental car is being booked for.
